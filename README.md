## [`salmon`](https://github.com/nicholaschiang/salmon)

This project is a parody of the original game Simon by Milton-Bradley.
It is a very basic repetitive memory game where one follows the demonstrated color sequence until one makes a mistake.
The longer the sequence one can repeat, the greater one's score becomes.

While building this example application, I felt quite limited by the no-CSS and no-JS constraint; more so by the no-CSS constraint, however (e.g. with SSR, you can get away with some pretty complex patterns all without a line of JS running client-side).
